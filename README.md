*  ***Templars*** use the devine power of the gods to deliver justice

*  ***Rogues*** rely on agility to swiftly crush any opposition

## RULES

The character *deck* is randomized and a *hand* of 5 cards are dealt to both players.

Each player chooses a **3-card battle-party** from their *hand* of five-random cards drawn from a common character *deck*, and places them face down, in opposition to the party selected by your opponent.

Both players reveal their choices by revealing their *battle party*, placing their chosen champions into the battlefield.. the BATLLE BEGINS!  A *battle* is a set of three face-to-face *skirmishes*.

Every *faction* is vulnerable to attack from its nemisis faction as shown:

*  ***Magicians*** are defeated by *rogues* and *sorcerors*.

*  ***Archers*** are defeated by *templars* and *magicians*.

*  ***Sorcerers*** are defeated by *archers* and *rogues*.

*  ***Templars*** are defeated by *sorcerors* and *magicians*.

*  ***Rogues*** are defeated by *templars* and *archers*.

If two members of the same *faction* clash during battle, the higher *class* is the victor.

Each player collects one (1) point for each victorious skirmish in the battle. 

Three (3) points are awarded per **battle**, or, one (1) per **skirmish**.

Two (2) bonus beefy-brawler points are awarded to the player with the battle party of the higher rank (the sum of all *rank* values) in their battle party.

All revealed cards then move to the communal discard pile, and each player draws into their hand, back up to five character cards, from the communal deck to prepare for the next battle.

If the deck runs out of character cards, the discard pile is randomized and becomes a new communal deck.

The games ends when a player reaches 25 points at the end of a battle.
